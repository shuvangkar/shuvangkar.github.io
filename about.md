Hi, Iâ€™m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, Inverter (DER, IBR), and AI â€” building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, Iâ€™m a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employerâ€™s views).

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter, reinforcement learning. I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
